An XSLT stylesheet tests which extensions are available in an XSLT processor.

Background
----------

XSLT processors may have extension functions and elements. The most well known
set of such extensions is the EXSLT project (http://exslt.github.io/). A 
processor may also implement its own extension functions. One such processor
is Apache Xalan (https://apache.github.io/xalan-c/extensionslib.html).

XSLT has a way to test whether a function or an element is available:

  function-available(name)
  element-available(name)

What the project does
---------------------

The project generates an XSLT file (the detector, 'detect.xslt') that tests 
the presense of all known XSLT extension functions and elements. It includes 
all functions and elements of EXSLT and Xalan.

The reason the code generates the detector is because it is simpler and less 
error-prone to do it this way: the source list of names is self-explanatory 
and the transformation code is simple, except for a workaround to generate 
namespace declarations. It is also easier to extend if such a need arises. 

Since the generated detector is immediately useful it is also kept as a part 
of the project.

List of files
-------------

  Makefile               -- build recipes. Run 'make' to see help.
  README                 -- this file
  out\
  |_ detect.xslt         -- the detector itself (generated)
  sample\                -- detection samples (generated)
  |_ chromium-brave.txt  -- a Chromium-based browser, here Brave
  |_ firefox.txt         -- FireFox
  |_ filemaker.txt       -- FileMaker v18, XML export.
  |_ libxslt.txt         -- libxslt (xsltproc).
  src\
  |_ make.xslt           -- transforms 'names.xml' into 'out/detect.xslt'
  |_ names.xml           -- extension names

Requirements
------------

To generate the detector the project expects to find 'xsltproc'. The 
'detect.xslt' itself can be used with any XSLT processor as it is.

Usage
-----

To generate a fresh detector ('out/detect.xslt'):

  make out/detect.xslt

To use the detector with an XSLT processor

  Apply 'detect.xslt' to any XML file. It is OK to use the detector itself. 
  The result will be a text file that shows the system information, list 
  extension URIs and marks each function and element with '+' (available) or
  '-' (not available).
  
  For an example of using it with 'libxslt' (xsltproc) see Makefile:
  
    make sample/libxslt.txt

To use the detector with a browser

  Open the 'detect.xslt' with a browser. (Drag it there.) The internal XML
  machinery will apply the XSLT to itself and you will see the result right
  in the browser window.
  
Warning
-------

It seems that a processor may falsely report a function or element as 
unavaiable. For example in my tests 'libxslt' ('xsltproc') shows that it does 
not have the '<function>' element of EXSLT functions extension. Yet it 
definitely does.
